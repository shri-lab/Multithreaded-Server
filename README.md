                                         MULTITHREADED JAVA CLIENT-SERVER PROJECT

This project demonstrates a multithreaded client-server architecture using Java sockets. The server is capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously, with each client connection managed in its own thread. Clients can request different tasks, such as reading a file, echoing a message, or requesting the current server time. The server parses each clientâ€™s request and executes the corresponding task independently.



FEATURES

-Multithreaded Server: Handles multiple client connections concurrently using threads.

-Flexible Task Assignment: Supports commands like file reading, echo, and time retrieval.

-Socket Communication: Uses TCP sockets for reliable client-server communication.

-Scalable Design: Easily extendable to support more tasks or clients.



HOW IT WORKS

-Server listens on a specified port and spawns a new thread for each client connection.

-Client connects to the server and sends a command indicating the desired task.

-Server thread reads the command, performs the requested task, and sends the result back to the client.

-Multiple clients can connect and interact with the server at the same time.



EDUCATIONAL VALUE

-Java network programming

-Multithreading and concurrency

-Client-server architecture

-Command parsing and task handling
